#### Written by Aman Chhabra

This Bot was created to showcase:
1. Cisco Spark
2. Internet of Things (IOT) Sensors
3. Programmability and APIs

It receives events from the IOT sensors connected to the Particle.io cloud and logs them in a MongoDB instance. A Spark Bot is connected to api.ai for natural language processing and receives incoming requests. Using webhook fulfillment the requests are processed and the Bot is able to output the time data.
